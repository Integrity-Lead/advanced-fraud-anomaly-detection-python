### 🕵️ Executive Summary
This project addresses one of the most critical challenges in modern financial systems: **detecting anomalous behavior** and ensuring **model reliability** within dynamic environments.

Powered by the **Isolation Forest algorithm**, the system identifies statistical outliers that traditional rule-based engines often fail to capture. Beyond detection, the architecture integrates a **Model Governance Layer** to continuously oversee integrity through statistical drift detection.

> **"We don't just build models; we govern their behavior in production."**

### ⚙️ How it Works
**[Transaction Data]** → **[Isolation Forest Engine]** → **[Anomaly Scores]** → **[Drift Monitoring Layer (KS Test)]** → **[Alert & Decision Layer]**

#### Process Breakdown:
*   **Input:** Transactional datasets (Numerical features).
*   **Detection:** Isolation Forest assigns anomaly scores.
*   **Flagging:** High-score transactions are classified as anomalies.
*   **Monitoring:** Baseline vs. Production comparison and Drift detection via the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test**.
*   **Output:** Anomaly alerts and Model Drift triggers (automated alerts).

*This visualization is the direct output of the Isolation Forest engine, isolating critical outliers (**Crimson**) from normal transactional flow.*

### 📊 Strategic Executive Dashboard (Power BI)

#### Executive Panel Metrics:
*   **Strategic KPI:** High anomaly detection consistency (~93%) in controlled environments.
*   **Visual Strategy:** Time-based anomaly segmentation.
*   **Objective:** Translating raw data into **actionable signals** for executive decision-making.

### 🐍 Layer 5 Governance: Model Integrity Monitoring
![Anomaly_Isolation_Map](Anomaly_Isolation_Map.png)
*Every **Magenta 'X'** represents a zero-day threat isolated by its statistical distance, ensuring reliability even when patterns are unknown.*

In production systems, detection is only half the battle. As data distributions shift over time (**Concept Drift**), models can quietly degrade, leading to critical failures.

#### Key Capabilities:
*   **Active Boundary Monitoring:** Ensures structural consistency between the **Trusted Baseline** and live production data.
*   **Statistical Drift Detection:** Continuous **p-value** analysis comparing baseline vs. live production stream.
*   **Automated Risk Response:** Triggers immediate alerts when model integrity is compromised or falls below safety thresholds.

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Usage
*   **Algorithm:** Isolation Forest (Unsupervised Anomaly Detection).
*   **Language:** Python 3.x | **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
*   **Visualization:** Power BI | **Methodology:** Agile (Scrum).

#### 🚀 Quick Start:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python isolation_forest_engine.py 
python drift_monitor.py
```

---

### 📈 Business & Strategic Impact
*   **Risk Prioritization:** Dynamic anomaly scoring framework (**70–95+ threshold**).
*   **Zero-Day Detection:** Identifies unknown patterns without the need for historical labeled data.
*   **Model Governance:** Real-time oversight of system integrity and performance.
*   **Decision Intelligence:** Directly bridges the gap between **Raw Data** and **Strategic Executive Decisions**.

### 🔮 Roadmap / Next Steps
*   **Real-time Stream Integration:** Full Kafka/API implementation for live environments.
*   **Automated Retraining Pipelines:** Closed-loop model updates to combat drift.
*   **Explainability Layer (SHAP):** Transparent auditing to understand the **"Why"** behind every flag.
*   **Production API Deployment:** Scalable microservices for enterprise-grade implementation.

### 📉 Visualizing the Strategic Risk Gap
The system generates a **Model Integrity Audit** report. When the **Production Data (Magenta)** deviates from the **Trusted Baseline (Blue)**, the "Observer Agent" alerts the C-Suite of a compromised state.
