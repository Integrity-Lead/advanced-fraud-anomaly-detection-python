## 📊 Layer5-Radar Backend Validation Protocol

### 📊 1. Mathematical Evaluation Framework
To eliminate rule-based validation blind spots and mitigate runtime semantic payload drift under compliance with the European AI Act, the Layer5 Homeostatic Integrity Radar implements a non-parametric unsupervised telemetry pipeline. The backend baseline is rigorously audited using a multi-dimensional mathematical matrix to certify day-zero drift containment:

#### A. Jaccard Similarity Index (Intersection over Union)
Measures the strict operational overlap between predicted anomalous payload boundaries (A) and true architectural violations (B). It ensures zero-tolerance thresholds against boundary degradation:

\[J(A, B) = \frac{\vert{}A \cap B\vert{}}{\vert{}A \cup B\vert{}}\]

#### B. F1-Score (Harmonic Mean of Precision and Recall)
Balances the mathematical distance between false positives (legitimate API traffic flagged as threat) and false negatives (undetected semantic anomalies hitting core database engines), maximizing homeostatic resilience:

\[F_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}\]

#### C. Multi-Class Logarithmic Loss (LogLoss)
Evaluates the strict probabilistic distance and uncertainty of the classifier's boundary telemetry. Lower LogLoss indexes guarantee microsecond-level determinism:

\[\text{LogLoss} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{M} y_{ij} \log(p_{ij})\]

---

### 💻 2. Production-Grade Scimitar Validation Script

## 🛡️ Multi-Model Predictive Defense Line (SVM & Logistic Classification)

### 🛡️ 1. Hyperplane Isolation & Probabilistic Risk Optimization
While non-parametric density engines excel at day-zero structural mapping, hardened Fintech architectures require a deterministic classification layer to enforce production-grade compliance. To address this, the Layer5 perimeter implements a hybrid predictive pipeline combining Support Vector Machines (SVM) with calibrated Logistic Classifiers.

By utilizing a high-dimensional Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, the SVM engine projects concurrent payload tensors into expanded vector spaces, drawing optimal separating hyperplanes that isolate adversarial traffic from legitimate banking streams. Concurrently, the Logistic Layer measures the strict cross-entropy risk vectors, translating raw boundary metrics into actionable probabilistic alerts for C-Suite governance.

### 🐍 Layer 5 Governance: Model Integrity Monitoring
<p align="center">
  <img src="Anomaly_Isolation_Map.png" width="800">
</p>


*Every **Magenta 'X'** represents a zero-day threat isolated by its statistical distance, ensuring reliability even when patterns are unknown.*

In production systems, detection is only half the battle. As data distributions shift over time **(Concept Drift)**, models can quietly degrade, leading to critical failures.

#### Key Capabilities:
*   **Active Boundary Monitoring:** Ensures structural consistency between the **Trusted Baseline** and live production data.
*   **Statistical Drift Detection:** Continuous **p-value** analysis comparing baseline vs. live production stream.
*   **Automated Risk Response:** Triggers immediate alerts when model integrity is compromised or falls below safety thresholds.

## 📡 Non-Parametric Density Isolation Layer (DBSCAN Integration)

### 📡 1. Autonomic Density Mapping & Latent Risk Containment
Traditional boundary models degrade when confronting multi-modal concurrent transaction streams or polymorphic injection vectors. To achieve absolute adaptive immunity, the Layer5 perimeter integrates a non-parametric density-based clustering algorithm (DBSCAN). 

By establishing spatial density thresholds rather than rigid hyperplanes, the engine automatically clusters normative transactional payloads based on architectural proximity, classifying low-density structural mutations as unmapped operational noise.

*   **Epsilon (ε):** Strict microsecond-level spatial radius bounds protecting Core Ingestion Vectors.
*   **MinSamples (\(N_{min}\)):** Minimum core density requirement to validate an autonomous workflow profile.
*   **Core Points vs. Noise:** Legitimate financial pipelines form high-density spatial topologies. Zero-day threats and semantic drifts fall outside these boundaries, isolated immediately as structural noise vertices without needing historical fraud labels.

---

### 💻 2. Unsupervised Core Density Extraction Script
This script targets and isolates latent operational risks by auditing core feature clusters and tagging outlying transactional packets in full production simulation:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def execute_density_perimeter_audit(transaction_matrix, epsilon=0.3, min_samples=10):
    """
    Executes unsupervised spatial mapping on live transactional streams.
    Isolates low-density architectural mutations and semantic payload noise.
    """
    # 1. Normalize high-frequency payload features to preserve metric distance
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    normalized_telemetry = scaler.fit_transform(transaction_matrix)
    
    # 2. Initialize and train the Density-Based Spatial Engine
    dbscan_engine = DBSCAN(eps=epsilon, min_samples=min_samples)
    cluster_labels = dbscan_engine.fit_predict(normalized_telemetry)
    
    # 3. Extract core spatial points and isolate outliers (Label == -1)
    core_samples_mask = np.zeros_like(cluster_labels, dtype=bool)
    core_samples_mask[dbscan_engine.core_sample_indices_] = True
    
    isolated_noise_mask = (cluster_labels == -1)
    total_anomalous_nodes = np.sum(isolated_noise_mask)
    
    # Telemetry Log
    print(f"[PERIMETER] Density Mapping Completed.")
    print(f"[SECURITY] Zero-Day Latent Mutations Isolated: {total_anomalous_nodes} nodes.")
    
    return {
        "labels": cluster_labels.tolist(),
        "total_anomalies": int(total_anomalous_nodes),
        "noise_vector_mask": isolated_noise_mask.tolist()
    }

# Production Simulation: 500 High-Frequency Fintech Log Ingestions
np.random.seed(1337)
normative_payloads = np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=(480, 3))
zero_day_mutations = np.random.uniform(low=-4.0, high=4.0, size=(20, 3))
live_stream = np.vstack([normative_payloads, zero_day_mutations])

# Run Live Production Density Isolation Loop
perimeter_telemetry = execute_density_perimeter_audit(live_stream, epsilon=0.5, min_samples=7)
```

> ⚙️ **Production Scaling Note ($O(N^2)$ Complexity Containment):** For environments processing >100k concurrent events per second, the native Euclidean distance matrix may experience memory degradation. In live enterprise edge nodes, this density isolation step is decoupled via a non-parametric indexing pipeline executed prior to matrix normalization.

# 🏛️🦾 UPDATE APRIL 2026: Autonomic Governance & Adaptive Immunity 

### "From Passive Observation to Active Systemic Immunity"

As AI ecosystems evolve towards **Agentic Autonomy**, traditional monitoring is no longer sufficient. This update introduces the **Autonomic Governance Audit**—a layer designed not just to detect drift, but to enforce **Operational Integrity** in real-time.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Sovereign_Autonomic_Immunity_2026.png" width="850">
</p>
---

### 🛡️ The Adaptive Immunity Engine
This new engine integrates **Unsupervised Outlier Detection (Isolation Forest)** with **Dynamic Distribution Analysis (KS-Test)** to identify and bridge the **Resilience Gap**.

**Key Architectural Upgrades:**
*   **Runtime Integrity Enforcement:** The system continuously audits the statistical distance between the **Trusted Baseline** and live execution.
*   **Autonomic Isolation Trigger:** If the **p-value** drops below the safety threshold (0.05), the system flags an immediate **"Compromised State"**, preventing the model from scaling technical chaos.
*   **Zero-Trust Telemetry:** We treat every execution as a data point for immunity, ensuring that **Model Drift** is contained before it impacts the business logic.

---

### 📈 Strategic Risk Visualization
The generated report now explicitly maps the **Resilience Gap**:
*   **Blue Zone (Trusted Integrity):** The stable operational boundary.
*   **Magenta Zone (Drifted Execution):** The identified risk that triggers the autonomic response.

> **"In the era of autonomous agents, governance is not a manual checklist; it is an immune system that defends the organization’s logic at machine speed."** 🏛️⚙️
